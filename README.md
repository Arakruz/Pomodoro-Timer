# Pomodoro Study Timer and Planner

## Project Overview

 **This project aims to** make an easy-to-use and highly customizable timer and planner for those trying to focus using 
 the *Pomodoro technique*. Pomodoro technique is a method of time management where you break down your work, study, or 
 focus time into:

- **Focus time**
   - The time when you focus on the task at hand, originally 25 minutes, but as you get more used to the method, this time
   can be significantly increased
   
- **Short Break**
   -  Between every focus time, there should be a break. In this case, it's a shorter break that helps to *assimilate 
    information* and give your brain a little rest. Originally done with 5 minutes but can vary wildly depending on your 
    focus time and how tiring you want to make your focus session.
    
- **Long Break**
    - After 4 focus times (or what I'm calling a cycle), your brain starts to lose performance and needs a long break,
    and that's what this is for! Originally 10 minutes but similarly to the short break can vary wildly. 

 I was already using this technique for quite a while and saw an impressive improvement in my study sessions. *However*, 
 I'm quite disappointed with the current apps in the market, always missing one or more features that I find essential. 
 That's why I decided to do this app, among other things, to allow the user to set up pre-made timers and use them to 
 make it *easier* and *simpler* to make use of this technique.
